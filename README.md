## Overview

This is a challenge from Frontend Mentor to build a rating component which responsive in both desktop and mobile view. I'm using pure HTML and CSS to solve this challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
